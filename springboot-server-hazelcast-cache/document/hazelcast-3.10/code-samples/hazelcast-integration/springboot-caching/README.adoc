Spring Boot Hazelcast Integration Example via http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html[Spring Framework Caching Abstraction]. 

NOTE: This example *doesn't* have the dependencies on JSR-107 / JCache jars.
For JCache example, use `springboot-caching-jcache` project.

This is an example of Spring Boot Caching Auto Configuration feature for Hazelcast and Spring Framework Caching Abstraction:

- A `BootifulMember` is a Spring Boot application with fully auto-configured embedded Hazelcast member.
During application startup, Spring Boot scans classpath for `hazelcast.xml` and automatically instantiates Spring's
`CacheManager` bean backed by `HazelcastInstance`.
Use `startBootifulMember.sh` to start a cluster member from command line.
- `BootifulClient` also uses Spring Boot auto configuration for Hazelcast.
It scans Spring Configuration for `CacheManager` bean backed by `HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClientinstance()` and picks `hazelcast-client.xml` from classpath.
Use `startBootifulClient.sh` to start a client and connect to the cluster from command line.

NOTE: By running `mvn package spring-boot:repackage`, Spring Boot maven plugin will generate executable jar `java -jar
 ..` with `BootifulMember` as a main class.
