# Sample Spring Boot Application to use Hazelcast for PCF

This is a sample Spring Boot application that exposes some basic Hazelcast map operations like `IMap#get`, `IMap#put`
through a RESTful Web Service interface.

This application uses Hazelcast Client to connect to a Hazelcast cluster thats deployed on 
[Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)](https://pivotal.io/platform) platform using [Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/).

## Creating a Hazelcast Cluster using Hazelcast for PCF

1) Download Hazelcast for PCF from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/)

2) Install Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF to your PCF setup. You can refer to Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/hazelcast/) for detailed installation instructions.

3) Check your Hazelcast installation using `cf marketplace` command. You should see "hazelcast" as a service after installation.

4) Create a service `cf create-service hazelcast PLAN_NAME SERVICE_NAME -c PATH_TO_hazelcast.json` command. Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF accepts configuration as JSON. You can use 
[hazelcast.json](hazelcast.json)  provided in this project by filling the `licensekey` section with a valid license.
[hazelcast.json](hazelcast.json) has two additional configuration options compared to the standard Hazelcast configuration.
- `instanceCount`: You can set number of desired Hazelcast members using this option while creating your Hazelcast service. 
Beyond that, you can change this parameter while updating your Hazelcast service (using `cf update-service`) to dynamically 
scale in/out your Hazelcast cluster.
- `mancenterAppName`: This option is only meaningful when Hazelcast Management Center is enabled using below configuration.
 This has to be a unique name as this name will be registered to your PCF app domain. (i.e; http://mancenter.apps.yourpcfdomain.com)
 Note :Leave the configuration as it is if you wouldn't like to start Management Center at this point.
```
...
"managementCenterConfig":{"enabled":true,"updateInterval":3}
...
"mancenterAppName":"mancenter"
```
5) Check you service status using `cf services`. In our case, there are two Hazelcast services available.

6) Build and push "pcf-integration" app using [deploy-app.sh](deploy-app.sh). This file uses [manifest.yml](manifest.yml),
you can modify it according to your needs.

```
applications:
- name: hazelcast-pcf-integration-test-app
  memory: 1024M
  instances: 1
  path: target/pcf-integration-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

7) Your first push attempt will fail since it needs a Hazelcast service. 
Bind the Hazelcast service that you've created in step 4 to your application using and restage your application;
```
cf bind-service hazelcast-pcf-integration-test-app  SERVICE_NAME (i.e: micro-hazelcast-with-mancenter)
cf restage hazelcast-pcf-integration-test-app
```

8) Now you can access your Hazelcast Cluster deployed on PCF using this application.
