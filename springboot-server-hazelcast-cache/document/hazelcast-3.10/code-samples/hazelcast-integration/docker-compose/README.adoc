.TL;DR
During webinar about «Distributed Caching for you next Node.js project» footnote:[https://hazelcast.com/resources/distributed-caching-next-node-js-project/] I was asked if we provide examples of running Hazelcast with Compose or Swarm.
Now you have it!
Full source code published in `hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples` repository footnote:[https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/hazelcast-integration/docker-compose]

NOTE: **Disclaimer:** It's not an introduction to `docker-compose`. 
To learn basic steps of `docker-compose`, please, refer to official `docker-compose` «getting started guide» footnote:[https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/]

== Into

From the perspective of containerization and cloud deployment, Hazelcast IMDG is a perfect candidate.

- Elastically Scalable
+
just add more servers, and they form the cluster automatically and contribute their memory to the «shared memory».
- Performs at in-memory transaction speeds
+
- Highly Available 
+
can deploy in backup pairs or https://hazelcast.com/products/wan-replication/[even WAN replicated]
- Fault Tolerant
+
no single point of failure

I've been working with few clients footnote:[https://hazelcast.com/services/consulting/] who have embraced containerization of their IMDG deployments.
And in this blog post, I explore how to use Docker Compose to scale Hazelcast IMDG cluster. 
Additionally, I will use  https://hazelcast.com/products/management-center/[Management Center] monitor IMDG cluster state.

== Getting Docker images

In this demonstration, I will be using official Hazelcast IMDG Docker images.
My demo application will contain three components:

- Hazelcast IMDG cluster
- Hazelcast Management Center
- Client Application

I will build docker image for my client app that will read and write to the Hazelcast IMDG cluster.

=== Official stuff 

You can find https://hub.docker.com/u/hazelcast/[officially supported images] in Docker Hub.
I will be using:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/hazelcast/[hazelcast/hazelcast] - OSS bits of Hazelcast
- https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/management-center/[hazelcast/management-center] - Management Center `.war` (free with 2 Hazelcast nodes)

=== Client app

A client app is a simple hazelcast client 

[source,java]
----
public class MyClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        
        ClientConfig clientConfig = new XmlClientConfigBuilder().build();   // <1>
        final HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig); // <2>

        System.out.println(clientConfig.toString());

        IQueue<String> queue = client.getQueue("queue");
        queue.put("Hello!");    // <3>
        System.out.println("Message sent by Hazelcast Client!");

        HazelcastClient.shutdownAll();
    }
}
----
<1> configured with `hazelcast-client.xml`
<2> connects to the cluster
<3> sends message to the IQueue

=== Building client app Docker image

In this example, to build docker image from «fat» jar, I use Spotify's `docker-maven-plugin` footnote:[https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin].

<2> builds docker image with Hazelcast client app and dependencies

== Enter Docker Compose 

Docker Compose allows you to define a multi-container application with all of its dependencies in a single file, then spin your application and dependencies up in a single command.
Navigate to directory `hazelcast-code-samples/hazelcast-integration/docker-compose/src/main/docker` and run the command.

.Start the cluster, a client, and management center containers
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose -f hazelcast.yml up -d
----

The `docker-compose` command will pull the images from Docker Hub and then link them together based on the information inside the `docker-compose.yml` (`hazelcast.yml` in out case) file. 
This will create ports, links between containers, and configure applications as required. 
After the command completes we can now view the status of our cluster with command `docker-compose ps`.

== Scaling

The fun part comes with scaling.
Let's scale out our Hazelcast IMDG cluster to 2 nodes

.docker-compose command for scaling Hazelcast cluster
----
docker-compose scale hazelcast=5
----

With a command `docker-compose ps` you see which containers are running now.

[source,sh]
----
❯ docker-compose -f src/main/docker/hazelcast.yml ps
           Name                         Command               State            Ports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker_hazelcast-client_1    /bin/sh -c echo "The appli ...   Exit 0
docker_hazelcast_1           ./server.sh                      Up       5701/tcp
docker_hazelcast_2           ./server.sh                      Up       5701/tcp
docker_hazelcast_3           ./server.sh                      Up       5701/tcp
docker_hazelcast_4           ./server.sh                      Up       5701/tcp
docker_hazelcast_5           ./server.sh                      Up       5701/tcp
docker_management-center_1   /bin/sh -c ./start.sh            Up       0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
----

If you open Management Center URL[http://localhost:8080/mancenter] you should see that cluster consists of 5 nodes now.

.Management Center web app displays IMDG cluster of 5 nodes
image::mancenter_1.png[]

WARNING: If at this point you get a message from Management Center to enter the license, you can request a trial key from here footnote:[https://hazelcast.com/hazelcast-enterprise-download/trial/]

Also, I can use `curl` command to get cluster status and the list of members.

.Query cluster status using Management Center
----
❯ curl http://localhost:8080/mancenter/rest/clusters/hz-compose/members
["172.18.0.3:5701","172.18.0.4:5701","172.18.0.5:5701","172.18.0.6:5701","172.18.0.7:5701"]
----

You can shutdown those application stack (IMDG cluster, Management center, Hazelcast client Java application) with single command

----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/hazelcast.yml down
----

== What's next?

In my future posts, I will explore other tools that allow you to deploy, scale and orchestrate your Hazelcast IMDG cluster with different tools like Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos.
