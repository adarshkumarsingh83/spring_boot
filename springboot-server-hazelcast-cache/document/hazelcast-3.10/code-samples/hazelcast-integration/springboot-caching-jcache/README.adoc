Spring Boot Hazelcast Integration via JCache Example

toc::[]

This is an example of Spring Boot Caching Auto Configuration feature for Hazelcast and JCache:

- `BootifulMember` uses Spring Boot auto configuration for Hazelcast.
It scans classpath for `hazelcast.xml` and automatically instantiates Spring's `CacheManager` bean with `HazelcastInstance`. 
Use `startBootifulMember.sh` to start a cluster member from command line.
- `BootifulClient` uses SpringBoot auto configuration for JCache. 
It scans classpath for `jcache` jars and instantiates `JCacheCacheManager` backed by `Caching.getCachingProvider()`.
Because Hazelcast client jar is in a classpath, by default, it uses the client caching provider and picks `hazelcast-client.xml` from classpath.
Use `startBootifulClient.sh` to start client and connect to the cluster.

By running `mvn package spring-boot:repackage`, Spring Boot maven plugin will generate executable jar `java -jar ..`
with  `BootifulMember` as a main class.
