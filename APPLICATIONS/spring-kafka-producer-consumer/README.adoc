## Getting Started
These instructions will show how to run kafka locally and how to install kafkacat, a tool to display messages in a kafka topic

### Run kafka locally
In a terminal cd to the root of this project and run
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Check both kafka and zookeeper are running
```
docker ps
```
### Install kafkacat
Install kafkacat utility using the local package manager.

```
sudo apt-get install kafkacat
```

# Start up the Producer, from the root of the project

[source, java]
----
cd sample-spring-kafka-producer
../gradlew bootRun
----

# Start up the Consumer

[source, java]
----
cd sample-spring-kafka-consumer
../gradlew bootRun
----


## At this point some sample messages can be generated using this endpoint:

http://localhost:8080/generateWork?id=1&definition=thisIsCool

The producer should print a message on the console that the Work unit has been dispatched and the consumer should receive and process the Work unit
